# Session 01: 09/07
## Instructions:
* filename: *01_compare.md*
* Compare two of the APCSP curricula that were provided (links bellow).
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative strengths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic particularly better/worse over the other. If both seem equally good then no need to comment).

## Assignment:
For this assignment I'll be comparing [Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/course/bjc4nyc.html) and [CodeHS Python](https://codehs.com/uploads/f40041ef134075e10ee0106a0861abe1).

### Major Differences
The first obvious major difference is that the two curriculums use different language to teach the course. BJC uses a language called Snap!, which is very similar to Scratch and Code.org. Instead of typing out the control structures, you drag-and-drop pre-structured blocks into a workspace. In this way, it is obvious that if statements require a conditional afterwards, and the end of a conditional or looping block is visually indicated. Proper indentation is essentially visually enforced, because you can *see* the block's start and end, rather than accidentally not conform to it while typing in Python. CHS Python uses a typical curriculum taught in Python and another language called Karel, a subset of Python. There are a lot of visual deliverables in BJC, whereas CHS Python is more satisfied with text and console-based interaction. 

The second major difference between the two is that BJC doesn't follow the steps of a class meant to teach you a the basics of just programming. The third unit consists entirely of information and discussions about networking and how the internet works, which puts the programming learning on pause for the length of the unit. 

A third major different is that BJC encourages the teacher to only teach the first 5 units, writing themselves that "units 6-8 are perfect to enjoy after the exam."

### Major Similarities
Both curriculums focus heavily on labs being used to practice concepts. There are extra labs in each topic to allow for generous practice of a topic such as loops, searching, or indexing. To be honest, this is the only main similarity. The cirriculums are very different, in my opinion.

### Comparative Strengths and Weaknesses
BJC, due to its more visual and drag-and-drop focus, is most likely better for younger students, or high schoolers who are slower typers. It is also more likely to produce higher AP scores among students who understand the programming less well, because it spends a sold amount of time on ethics and internet history and inner workings in a wway that is not impeded by low programming skills. 

CodeHS will result in many more transferable Python skills to environments other than a school environment, and be more readily applicable to personal projects students might be inclined to undertake. The overall success of this curriculum likely depends on where the students are in their math, typing, and readiness for Python.
