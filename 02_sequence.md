# **02_sequence.md**
In the past few assignments, you have been looking into creating a new course.
Come up with the big units of the class, and provide a sequence for them.
After listing the units in order, provide a narative describing _why_ youâ€™ve ordered them that way. Thigns to consider:
- Necessary prior knowledge.
- Natural segues.
- Natural places to shift gears.
- etc.

1. Python philosophy + flow
2. Functions
3. Control structures
4. Data structures
5. Object oriented programming

I start with "Python philosophy + flow" because in the beginning of the class, students are still getting comfortable with how the typed words create code on the screen. This unit will be short, but will introduce students to what they can get away with and what the can't, how to read errors, how to troubleshoot, how to test code, and how to spin up new REPLs in which they can run tests in a sandbox. 

Once students have been typing things for long enough, we introduce functions, which is as much about introducing indentation as it is about introducing functions. Functions will mainly be taught as a means of saving you time and organizing your code, which at this point in the class would have gotten quite long without a function. Students will be making shapes using the functions that they've created, and also use pre-created functions to do assigned tasks. Students will also familiarize themselves with the indented block as being something that ends when the first line of non-indented code is written. Blocks of code exist in many other languages, and the idea of the "block" of code is the goal here. 

Control structures will be where a lot of time is spent creating cool shapes/designs/utilities. By now, students know how indentation works, so if/else, while, and for will be introduced in the appropriate sequence and with the appropriate context for them to master the concept and then practice them using the experience that they have with functions and writing Python. 

Data structures will come next, which will really allow students to practice their control structures. As in most fundamentals classes, learning about data structures always comes with the activity of accessing elements at a certain index, which is a great way to practice for, while, and enhanced for loops. 

Lastly, Objects and Classes will be taught, which focuses on creating multiple turtles, and creating classes that simplify and abstract away the drawing of specific shapes. Students will create the square Class, which has an update() method, for example. This will also come hand in hand with animation and hiding the turtle's movements, and understanding _why_ we can do that in object-based programming languages.
