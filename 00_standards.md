## Instructions:
* filename: **00_standards.md**
* Imagine that you can create any Computer Science class you want. What would it be? For this assignment:
  * Provide a high level description of the course.
    * Include main topic(s) and grade level.
  * Explain the motivation behind wanting to create the course.
  * List the NY State standards you believe you would cover in this course. [standards link]

## Assignment:
If I could create any Computer Science class I wanted, I would create an introduction to Computer Science in Python using Turtle. It would pass through all of the topics that an AP CS Principles course would pass through, except that there would be the benefit of students getting a visual respresentation of their code. There is also the ability to ask students to write code that creates a design rather than completes a specific task. 

The grade level for this course would likely be 9th and 10th graders, although it could certainly be slowed down (and cover less material) for 7th and 8th graders. It would take the common route:
1. Getting started
    - printing, pen up, pen down
2. Variables
    - multiple turtles, math, input()
3. Conditionals
    - draw up to a certain point, prompt user for directions
4. Loops
    - get designs to be repeated multiple times
    - change colors slowly
    - "bottles of milk on the wall" still done in the console.
5. Functions
    - functions that contain designs or color properties
    - further practice can still use console
6. etc...

I don't think there's anything wrong with common curricula for APCSP, but I do think that there is some student motivation to be found in the visuals and animation components. There's something about creating moving and colorful things that catches soome students' attention and might draw them to work on things outside of class, draw connections, or get excited in some way that they might not have if the class were only taught through text. 

### Standards:
- **IC.6** - 
Create accessible computational
artifacts that meet standard
compliance requirements or otherwise
meet the needs of users with
disabilities.
- **CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.
- **CT.5** -
Modify a function or procedure in a
program to perform its computation in
a different way over the same inputs,
while preserving the result of the
overall program.
- **CT.6** -
Demonstrate how at least two classic
algorithms work and analyze the
trade-offs related to two or more
algorithms for completing the same
task.
- **CT.7** -
Design or remix a program that
utilizes a data structure to maintain
changes to related pieces of data.
- **CT.8** -
Develop a program that effectively
uses control structures in order to
create a computer program for
practical intent, personal expression,
or to address a societal issue.
- **CT.9** -
Systematically test and refine
programs using a range of test cases,
based on anticipating common errors
and user behavior.
- **CT.10** -
Collaboratively design and develop a
program or computational artifact for
a specific audience and create
documentation outlining
implementation features to inform
collaborators and users.

Explain the levels of interaction
existing between the application
software, system software, and
hardware of a computing system.

order to use new and emerging
technologies on multiple platforms.
