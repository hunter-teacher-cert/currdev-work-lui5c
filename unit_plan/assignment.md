  * ~~This should still be a markdown file~~
* lessons/
  - Folder containing a separate file for each lesson.
  - These files can be in a format of your choice, please do not include links to google docs, if it started out as a google doc, save it as some stand alone format and place it here.
  - Each lesson should be named __##\_TOPIC__ i.e. __00\_intro__

    - Main objective
    - Standards
    - In class exercises
    - Notes
    - Handouts
    - Resources
    - Assignments

  * all source code files should go here
