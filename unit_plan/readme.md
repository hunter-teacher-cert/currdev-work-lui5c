## General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
In this unit, we'll get into what "ones and zeroes" and "it's all binary" really means. We'll learn about binary, bits, bytes, encodings, and how the electronics of the computer all come together in painstakingly calculated synchronization so that you can look of pictures of cats on the Google Images.
