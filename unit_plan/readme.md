# Lists and Loops Unit
by Luis Collado

-----

## General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
In my theoretical class of Intro to Programming with Python with Turtle, we'll have a unit called lists and loops. We'll start with lists, then learn `while`, and then learn `for`. 

---

## Motivation for Unit
In an introductory course, you need to cover control structures and data structures. I think that the list is the most important data structure in Python, so it should be covered before tuples and dictionaries.
