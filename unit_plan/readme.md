# Lists and Loops Unit
by Luis Collado

-----

## General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
In my theoretical class of Intro to Programming with Python with Turtle, we'll have a unit called lists and loops. We'll start with lists, then learn `while`, and then learn `for`. 

**Class 1** - Conditionals Review & Intro to while loops

**Class 2** - While loops lab

**Class 3** - While loops quiz, Intro to for loops

**Class 4** - For loops lab

**Class 5** - For loops quiz, intro to lists

**Class 6** - while loops and lists lab

**Class 7** - for loops and lists lab

**Class 8** - lists quiz, begin final lab

**Class 9** - final lab

**Class 10** - lists + loops test

## Motivation for Unit
In an introductory course, you need to cover control structures and data structures. I think that the list is the most important data structure in Python, so it should be covered before tuples and dictionaries.

## Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

**9-12.NSD.3 - Develop and communicate multi-step troubleshooting strategies others can use to identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.**
