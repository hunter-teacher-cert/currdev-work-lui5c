# Lists and Loops Unit
by Luis Collado

-----

## General Overview
*(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)*  
In my theoretical class of Intro to Programming with Python with Turtle, we'll have a unit called lists and loops. We'll start with `while`, then learn `for`, and then learn lists. 


---

## Motivation for Unit
In an introductory course, you need to cover control structures and data structures. I think that the list is the most important data structure in Python, so it should be covered before tuples and dictionaries.

## Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

**9-12.NSD.3 - Develop and communicate multi-step troubleshooting strategies others can use to identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.**

## Tools Used
(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)
- Code.org's The Artist
- Replit
- Pen and paper

## Resources
(include any links/books/readings to be used during this unit)
