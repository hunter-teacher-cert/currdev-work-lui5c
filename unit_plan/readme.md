# Lists and Loops Unit
by Luis Collado

-----

## General Overview
*(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)*  
In my theoretical class of Intro to Programming with Python with Turtle, we'll have a unit called lists and loops. We'll start with `while`, then learn `for`, and then learn lists. This unit would go inside of the fictional class "Intro to Python featuring Turtle", because Turtle isn't used all the time in the class. Before this class, students would have already mastered:  
* **Unit 1** - Variables & Python
* **Unit 2** - Conditionals  

Students would then go on to learn functions, classes, recursion, etc. This unit wouldn't be super far in the year, but isn't the first thing students are learning. 

This fictional class is highly structured - every topic gets its practice time, and every new topic means it's time for a quiz on the previous topic.

## Motivation for Unit
In an introductory course, you need to cover control structures and data structures. I think that the list is the most important data structure in Python, so it should be covered before tuples and dictionaries. My reason for writing this unit with Turtle is that Python with Turtle is a useful tool for instruction - if it helps, then it is available, and if it doesn't help students, then there is the rest of the unit work to support their learning of a topic. Sometimes what can make something click for a student is an alternate mode of presentation of the same content.

## Standards Referenced
*List the NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)*


**9-12.CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

**9-12.CT.8** - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

**9-12.CT.9** - Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

**9-12.CT.10** - Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

## Assesments

* **Summative Assessments**
  - three summative assessments take place in the form of re-takable review quizzes.
  - one final summative assessment is administered at the end of the unit. 
* **Formative Assessments** 
  - Students are consistently producing work, whether it is the practice exercises, lab assignments, or extension work. This work is all collected and used to inform instruction.
