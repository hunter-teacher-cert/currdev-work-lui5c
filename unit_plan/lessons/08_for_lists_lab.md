# Class 08 - lists + definite loops practice

### Learning Objective[s]

* Students will be able to write programs that use for loops and lists together.   
* Students will be able to write programs with significant code inside of a for loop.

### Standards

* **9-12.CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

* **9-12.CT.8** - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

* **9-12.CT.9** - Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

* **9-12.CT.10** - Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.


### Materials & Resources

```python
# Lists + For lab
"""
Ice Cream Combinations
The person using your program runs a frozen yogurt shop. They would like to make a banner sharing how many combinations of frozen yogurt, mix-ins, and toppings are available. They hire you to write a program to find out all of the available combinations. Combinations look like this:

Vanilla
Chocolate with blueberries and chocolate sprinkles
Strawberry with boba
"""

# Task 1: Create 4 empty lists:
# flavors, mixins, toppings, and all_combinations


# Task 2: using .append(), populate your first 3 lists.
# Flavors: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, butter pecan, and mango
# Mix-ins: blueberries, boba, strawberries, granola, oreo
# Toppings: rainbow sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles, caramel syrup, chocolate syrup


# Task 3: Use a for loop to add each flavor to the all_combinations list. 



# Task 4: Use two different for loops to add all combinations of 1 flavor and 1 mixin to the all_combinations list. 


# Task 5: Use three different for loops to add all combinations of 1 of each ingredient to the all_combinations list. 


# Task 6: Go back and make sure that the combinations in your list look good when printed. 

# Task 7: print all combinations with a comma in between them. Print out how many combinations there are.

# Extension task 1: use list.index(element) and the following pricing lists to add a price to each combination:
flavor_price = [2, 1.8, 2.2, 3, 1.5]
mixin_price = [2, 1, 2, 2, 1]
topping_price = [1, 1, 2, 2]

# Extension task 2: Expand your program to work with user input - use while loops to accomplish the user input. Do not worry about prices with this extension.
