# lessons 
  Folder containing a separate file for each lesson.
  - These files can be in a format of your choice, please do not include links to google docs, if it started out as a google doc, save it as some stand alone format and place it here.
  - Each lesson should be named __##\_TOPIC__ i.e. __00\_intro__
  - I will not specify a specific format for lessons, but each one should include all lesson components which may include (but not limited to):
    - Main objective
    - Standards
    - In class exercises
    - Notes
    - Handouts
    - Resources
    - Assignments
