Indefinite (while) Loops Lab I

In this lab, we will make a guessing game using while loops. 

The computer will generate a random number between 0 and 100.

The user will guess what the number is.

After each guess, the computer will say, "Too low!" 
or "Too high!" to guide the user to the correct answer.

When the user finally gets the answer right, the computer
will tell them that they are correct and tell them how many
tries it took them to get the number correct. 

Example game:
Welcome to the number guessing game!
Guess a number: 5
Too low!
Guess again: 28
Too low!
Guess again: 57
Too high!
Guess again: 44
Too low!
Guess again: 50
Too low!
Guess again: 54
Too high!
Guess again: 51
Congratulations, you got it!
It only took you 7 tries. 

Extensions to lab 1:
1. Expand your program to allow the user to play again
without re-running the program. 
2. Expand your program to keep track of a high score. 
Whenever the user sets a high score, 
have the program ask their name.
