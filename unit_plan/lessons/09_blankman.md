# Class 09 - lists + loops practice

### Learning Objective[s]

* Students will be able to write a program without programming scaffolding that uses while loops, for loops, and lists.   
* Students will be able to make design choices for a program based on design constraints.

### Standards

* **9-12.CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

* **9-12.CT.8** - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

* **9-12.CT.9** - Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

* **9-12.CT.10** - Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.


### Materials & Resources

```python
""""
Blankman

You know the game where people guess a word, letter by letter? Implement your own version of it. It can work however you want it to - however, these are the requirements:

1. The user should guess letters by typing them and pressing enter
2. The program should  display the word, with blanks, each time the user is about to guess a new letter.

To start with, the word that is being guessed is "programming".

# Extension: Make your program resistant to many different kinds of input (entire words, integers for guesses, etc.). 
```
