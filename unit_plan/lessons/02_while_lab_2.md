# Class 02 - indefinite practice ii

### Learning Objectives

* Students will be able to apply their knowledge of while loops to create designs that meet specific criteria in Python with Turtle.

* Students will be able to work with starter-code constraints to construct their own program.

### Standards

* **9-12.CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

* **9-12.CT.8** - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.


### Materials & Resources

Students will be coding using this file as starter code:
```python
"""
Indefinite Loops (while) Lab II

Use this starter code to create the design goal.

Don't change the setup code OR the code sandwiched between comments that say "DON'T TOUCH!"

"""

# setup - do not change!
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
s = turtle.Screen()
s.setup(1.0, 1.0)
t.penup()
t.speed(0)

t.goto(-200, 150)
t.pendown()
t.setheading(0)

# END TRIANGLE CODE --- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




# DONT TOUCH
t.penup()
t.goto(50, 150)
t.pendown()
t.setheading(0)
# DON'T TOUCH





# SQUARE CODE --- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

# END SQUARE CODE--- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^






# DON'T TOUCH

## Handouts

## In-Class Exercises

The class is a lab, so students will use the above starter file and spend the class doing that activity. 

The extension assignment is to create the odd-vertices star code. 
Extension beyond that is the extension of the number-guessing game from lab 1 - adding a high score.

## Assignments

The homework is to:
* finish any late homework for 10% off 
* finish any remaining work on either of the 2 the labs
* study for the while loops quiz next class
