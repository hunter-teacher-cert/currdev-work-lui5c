# Class 02 - indefinite practice ii

### Learning Objective[s]

### Standards

* **9-12.CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

* **9-12.CT.8** - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

* **9-12.CT.9** - Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

* **9-12.CT.10** - Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.


### Materials & Resources

Students will be coding using this file as starter code:
```python
"""
Indefinite Loops (while) Lab II

Use this starter code to create the design goal.

Don't change the setup code OR the code sandwiched between comments that say "DON'T TOUCH!"

# setup - do not change!

## Handouts

## In-Class Exercises

The class is a lab, so students will use the above starter file and spend the class doing that activity. 

The extension assignment is to create the odd-vertices star code. 

## Assignments

The homework is to finish any late homework for 10% off and to finish any remaining work on the labs.
