Indefinite Loops (while) Lab II

Use this starter code to create the design goal.

Don't change the setup code OR the code sandwiched between comments that say "DON'T TOUCH!"

## Handouts

## In-Class Exercises

The class is a lab, so students will use the above starter file and spend the class doing that activity. 

The extension assignment is to create the odd-vertices star code. 

## Assignments

The homework is to finish any late homework for 10% off and to finish any remaining work on the labs.
