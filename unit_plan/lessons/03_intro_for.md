# Class 03 - intro to definite loops

## Assignment - For loops homework
### Description
The purpose of this assignment is for you to further practice the for loops that we practiced in class today.   
For each exercise, write your code under the appropriate comment.  
For each exercise, pass `end=' '` to your `print` statements, like this:  
```python
print("hello", end="")
```
This makes your output easier to inspect.
### Assignment
1. Write a for loop that prints each number from 1 to 10. 
2. Write a for loop that prints each number from 1 to 100.
3. Write a for loop that prints each odd number from 1 to 99. 
4. Write a for loop that prints the first 10 perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc. -- perfect squares have square roots that are whole numbers.)
5. Change the 0 on line A so that this program to count from 0 to 99. 
```python
for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
        print(0, end='') ### line A
```
6. Write a program that asks the user for an integer and then uses a for loop to the first 5 multiples of that integer.

```python
# Assignment 2 Starter Code

# Exercise 1
# Write a for loop that prints each number from 1 to 10. 
print("\nExercise 1")



# Exercise 2
# Write a for loop that prints each number from 1 to 100.
print("\nExercise 2")



# Exercise 3
# Write a for loop that prints each odd number from 1 to 99. 
print("\nExercise 3")



# Exercise 4
# Write a for loop that prints the first 10 perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc. -- perfect squares have square roots that are whole numbers.)
print("\nExercise 4")



# Exercise 5
# Change only line A so that this program counts from 0 to 99. 
print("\nExercise 5")

for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
        print(0, end=' ') ### line A


# Exercise 6
# Write a program that asks the user for an integer and then uses a for loop to print the first 5 multiples of that integer.
print("\nExercise 6")
