Assignment 2 Starter Code
For each exercise, pass `end=' '` to your `print` statements, like this:

print("hello", end="")

This makes your output easier to inspect.

# Exercise 1
# Write a for loop that prints each number from 1 to 10. 
print("\nExercise 1")



# Exercise 2
# Write a for loop that prints each number from 1 to 100.
print("\nExercise 2")



# Exercise 3
# Write a for loop that prints each odd number from 1 to 99. 
print("\nExercise 3")



# Exercise 4
# Write a for loop that prints the first 10 perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc. -- perfect squares have square roots that are whole numbers.)
print("\nExercise 4")



# Exercise 5
# Change only line A so that this program counts from 0 to 99. 
print("\nExercise 5")

for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
        print(0, end=' ') ### line A


# Exercise 6
# Write a program that asks the user for an integer and then uses a for loop to print the first 5 multiples of that integer.
print("\nExercise 6")



# Extension Exercises
# 1. Write a program that sums up all of the 
#    numbers from 1 to a given number, using
#    a for loop. 
# 
# 2. Write a program that uses a for loop to 
#    determine how many digits are in an integer. 
#
# 3. Write a program that uses for loops 
#    or while loops to determine if a 
#    number is prime. 
# 
# print("Extension Exercises:")
