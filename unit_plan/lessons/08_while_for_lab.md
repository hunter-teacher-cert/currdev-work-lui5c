# Class 08 - lists + definite loops practice

### Learning Objective[s]

### Standards

* **9-12.CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

* **9-12.CT.8** - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

* **9-12.CT.9** - Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

* **9-12.CT.10** - Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.


### Materials & Resources

```python
# Lists + While lab

# Task 1: write a program that asks the user for integers to be put into a list. Convert every number that the user enters into an integer and then append the integers to a list. When the user types "done", stop adding to the list. 

# Task 2: write a while loop that goes through the list that the user generated and prints out the maximum value.

# Task 3: write a while loop that goes through the list that the user generated and prints out the minimum value. 

# Extension task: See if you can use your knowledge of loops and lists to sort the list of integers from smallest to greatest. 
```
