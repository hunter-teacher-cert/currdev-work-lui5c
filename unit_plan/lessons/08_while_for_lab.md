# Task 1: write a program that asks the user for integers to be put into a list. Convert every number that the user enters into an integer and then append the integers to a list. When the user types "done", stop adding to the list. 

# Task 2: write a while loop that goes through the list that the user generated and prints out the maximum value.

# Task 3: write a while loop that goes through the list that the user generated and prints out the minimum value. 

# Extension task: See if you can use your knowledge of loops and lists to sort the list of integers from smallest to greatest.
