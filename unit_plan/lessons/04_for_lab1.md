For this lab, you'll be implementing all of the exercises that we did for while loops, except using for loops. 

"""
Indefinite Loops

Indefinite Loops are like if statements, except that the conditional at the top is RE-RUN AT THE END OF THE BLOCK.

Exercise 1:
Below is an infinitely running while loop. 
Fix it to print the numbers 0-4, inclusive. 
"""

# # Uncomment these lines by highlighting all of them and pressing Ctrl + /

# print("Exercise 1:")
# count = 0 

# while count == 0:
#   print(count)

"""
Exercise 2:

Write a while loop that prints out the numbers 0-10, inclusive.
"""

# put exercise 2 here. 

# print("Exercise 2:")


"""
Exercise 3:

Write a while loop that prints the following output:
a
aa
aaa
aaaa
aaaaa
aaaaaa
"""
# write exercise 3 here.

# print("Exercise 3:")

"""
Exercise 4:

Write a while loop that prints every even number from 0 to 100. 
"""

# write exercise 4 here.

# print("Exercise 4:")

"""
Exercise 5:
Write a while loop that prints the first 20 powers of 2.
(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc...)
"""

# write exercise 5 here. 

# print("Exercise 5:")

"""
Exercise 6:
Write a short program that takes a number from the user, and counts down from that number. 
"""

# write exercise 6 here. 

# print("Exercise 6:")

# number = int(input("What number are we counting down from?"))


"""
Independent practice:

Using the modulo operator (%) and while and if, 
write a program that prints out all of the 
factors of a number. Here is a useful (!) snippet
of code that prints a factor if it is a factor of
a number.

if number % factor == 0:
  print(factor)

Your program should:
1. Ask the user for a number.
2. Create a variable called factor
3. Have a while loop that uses factor and number in the conditional
4. Have an if statement in the for loop
5. Have a print statement in the if block
"""

# write your independent practice program below. 



"""
Optional challenges:

1. Write a program that asks the user for a number, n, 
and prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

2. Write a program that makes a zigzag pattern
in the terminal, like this:
_____
____
___
__
_

_
__
___
____
_____
____
___
etc.
Hint: You will need 1 while loop and 2 for loops for this.
