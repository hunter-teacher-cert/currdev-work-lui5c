# Class 04 - definite loops practice 2

### Learning Objectives

* Students will be able to apply their knowledge of for loops to Python with Turtle scenarios.  
* Students will be able to independently troubleshoot and debug their Python with Turtle code. 

### Standards

* **9-12.CT.4** - Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

* **9-12.CT.8** - Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

* **9-12.CT.10** - Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.


### Materials & Resources

Students will be coding using this file as starter code:
```python
"""
Definite Loops (for) Lab II

Use this starter code to create the design goal.

Don't change the setup code OR the code sandwiched between comments that say "DON'T TOUCH!"

"""

# setup - do not change!
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
s = turtle.Screen()
s.setup(1.0, 1.0)
t.penup()
t.speed(0)

t.goto(-200, 150)
t.pendown()
t.setheading(0)



# BEGIN TRIANGLE CODE --- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv


# END TRIANGLE CODE --- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




# DONT TOUCH
t.penup()
t.goto(50, 150)
t.pendown()
t.setheading(0)
# DON'T TOUCH





# SQUARE CODE --- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

# END SQUARE CODE--- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^






# DON'T TOUCH
t.penup()
t.goto(-200, -50)
t.pendown()
t.setheading(0)
# DON'T TOUCH







# BEGIN STAR CODE --- vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

# END STAR CODE --- ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^




# DON'T TOUCH
